# Bootloader
Project developed for the Software Infrastructure course, using Assembly x86 NASM.

It is a terminal-based program that can do some basic operations, like add, multiply, divide or subtract two numbers, and has a little game called Smart Guessing, on which the player needs to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 999 in less than 10 tries.

# Compilation
You must be running a Linux operating system and have QEMU and NASM packages. If those criteria are met, then you just need to open the terminal, go to the bootloader's directory and type 'make all' (without apostrophes).
