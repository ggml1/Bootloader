# Bootloader
Project developed for the Software Infrastructure course, using Assembly x86 NASM.

# Compilation
You must be running a Linux operating system and have QEMU and NASM packages. If those criteria are met, then you just need to open the terminal, go to the bootloader's directory and type 'make all' (without apostrophes).
